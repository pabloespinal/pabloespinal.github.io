## My motivation for this project is to start a personal portfolio that will improve over time.

## This project was built as my firts assignment for my Web development course.

## This portfolio allows me to have my first exposure on promoting my carrier.

# I learned how to use CSS to another lever, practiced linking font awesome and bootsrap and how to insert and increase size of icons.

# Main challanges I encounterd were mainly sizing icons and increasing them in size.
